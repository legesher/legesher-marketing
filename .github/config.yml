  💖 Thanks for opening this pull request! 💖

  At Legesher, we welcome all contributions. We appreciate you taking the time to contribute.

  We understand that it can be overwhelming to open your first pull request, but don't worry, we're here to help you make it a clean and successful one.

  To streamline the release process, we use [semantic commit messages](https://docs.legesher.io/the-official-things/contributing-guidelines#commit-message-guidelines). Before your pull request can be merged, please **update your pull request title** to start with a semantic prefix.

  Here are some examples of commit messages with semantic prefixes:

  - `fix: don't overwrite prevent_default if default wasn't prevented`
  - `feat: add app.isPackaged() method`
  - `docs: app.isDefaultProtocolClient is now available on Linux`

  To ensure a smooth review process, please consider the following:

  - Follow the JavaScript, C++, and Python [coding style](https://docs.legesher.io/legesher-docs/coding-style).
  - Run `npm run lint` locally to catch formatting errors earlier.
  - Document any user-facing changes you've made following the [documentation styleguide](https://docs.legesher.io/legesher-docs/style-guide).
  - Include tests when adding/changing behavior.
  - Whenever possible, include screenshots and animated GIFs to showcase your changes.

  Thank you for your contribution, and we look forward to working with you on this pull request!
